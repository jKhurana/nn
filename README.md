Deep neural network has shown tremendous improvements over differnet areas like Natural Langage processing(NLP), Computer Vision, Financial Market etc.
Goal of this codebase is to implement basic deep learning or ML algorithms to understand them better. I will be using scikit-learn, pandas, numpy , tensorflow libraries to implement ML algorithms.
Here are the list of algorithms which are planned to be part of repository:

Basic ML Algorithms using scikit-learn:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
Gradient Decision Tree(Xgboost)

Deep Models with tensorflow:

FeedForward Network
AutoEncoder
Variational AutoEncoder
Recurrent Neural Network
LSTM
LSTM Encoder-Decoder Architecture
LSTM with Attention Model 

If time permits, we will also implement BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

Term and Conditions:

You are free to use above code in your assignments OR learning purpose.
